## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository** or download the source code.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/golden-cube.git
````

2. **Open `index.html`** in your preferred browser.

3. **Ensure the folder structure is intact**, especially for:

   * `/golden_cube_gallery/` → images

## ✨ Customization Tips

* **Logo**: Replace the demo logo in the header section with your own:

  ```html
  <img src="./assets/logo.png" alt="Golden Cube Logo" class="logo-img">
  ```

* **Social Media Links**: Update the `<a>` tags in the contact section to point to your real profiles.

* **Image Modal Logic**: JS is already set up to allow forward/back navigation and a close button.
